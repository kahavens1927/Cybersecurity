                <h1> Types of Cyber <br> Attacks </h1>

               <h3> Social engineering techniques are used to get victims 
                to divulge passwords or release data. Spam emails take up 
                time and flood the internet. E-mail scams and advance fee 
                fraud have cost unsuspecting receivers vast amounts of time and money. 
                Phishing and spear phishing lead to inadvertent disclosure of important 
                information. Pharming, with associated fake web sites makes the internet 
                ever more untrustworthy. Rogue anti-virus sites make it unsafe to take 
                advice to protect your device. </h3>

                <h1> What is Data Transmission </h1>

                <h3> Information sent on the lines of the internet is open to being intercepted
                     and read, so encryption is used to protect messages from unintended 
                     interceptors. On the receiving end, decryption renders the ciphertext 
                     into plaintext, so it can be read by the intended receiver. Data is 
                     encrypted using cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic keys.
                    SSL and it's successor, TLS, are responsible for the green padlock in web 
                    browsers, and provide secure communications. SSH is used to remotely log in 
                    to another computer and create a secure connection to issue commands. </h3>

                <h1> Authentication is Important </h1>

                <h3> Authentication is the term given to processes like logging in with a user 
                    id and password. Two-factor authentication and strong passwords improve 
                    security. Password entropy measures how difficult it is to crack a password. 
                    A password manager helps with security and retrieval of passwords. Hackers use 
                    what's termed a brute force attack to uncover a password, and sometimes a 
                    dictionary attack. Hackers gather accessible information about a person, and 
                    form a rainbow table, to uncover passwords. Digital Certificates are used to 
                    verify identity, but even these can be faked. </h3>
